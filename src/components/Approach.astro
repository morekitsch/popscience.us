                Strategy without execution is just ideas. Good product work
                means refining concepts into testable, buildable pieces that
                ship.

                Pushback isn't about saying no. It's finding what can ship now
                and what belongs later. Simplifying bad features into foundation
                blocks instead of half-implementations.

                Production means shipping on time. Sometimes that's a lean v1
                that validates assumptions. Sometimes it's digging through
                archives of a failed product to find what should have shipped
                originally.
